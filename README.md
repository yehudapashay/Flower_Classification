# Flower classification using deep neural network with TensorFlow.

This is a flower classification system based on deep neural network model to recognize and distinguish between 5 types of flowers (Daisy, Dandelion, Rose, Sunflower and Tulip). 
The system contains a model that we trained on over more than 4,00 images.
The flowers classification can be done per this model or another model that the user chooses (h5 file).
* Graphs that representing the training and validation (accuracy and loss) are attached below.

<H2>Features </H2>

* You can use the existing model or load your own model for the flowers classification.
* The classifications can be viewed visually in the system, and in addition as a list in the results file.

<H2> Prerequisites </H2>

In the project we have used in windows, Python 3.6 ,numpy and TensorFlow.
*	Python 3.6 .
*	TensorFlow 1.14 .
*	numpy 1.17 .
*	Pillow 6.1.0.
*	matplotlib 3.1.1.

<H2>Running</H2>
  
For running the program please run the Flower_Classification file.
Use the ‘Browse’ buttons to choose the images folder and the model file.
Choose the ‘Predict’ button to classify the images in the folder.

<H2>Results</H2>
  
After clicking the ‘Predict’ button, the classification results will appear in the main program window, so you can scroll down and see the classification for each image.
In addition, the project folder will contain a results.csv file. This file will contain all the images names and their classification according to the selected model.
